# Session Execution Instructions

You are operating under the Bara-v1 two-actor model with FULL AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION rights.

The `.claude/settings.json` file grants you permission to:
- Create, edit, and manage ALL files
- Run ALL bash commands (npm, git, etc.)
- Execute entire sessions without individual approvals

**DO NOT ASK FOR PERMISSION** for any action covered in the session document.

Execute Session X located at: /sessions/session-XX-description.md

Report back only when:
1. Session is complete
2. You encounter a blocker
3. Verification reveals issues

Begin autonomous execution now.
