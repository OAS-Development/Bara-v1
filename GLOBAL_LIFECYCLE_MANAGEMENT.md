# Global Development Lifecycle Management
## Universal Project Phase Transition Framework

### üéØ **Universal Application Across All Projects**

This framework applies to **EVERY** project using the two-actor development model, regardless of:
- Project domain (productivity, e-commerce, content management, etc.)
- Technology stack (React, Vue, Python, etc.)
- Project size (small utility vs enterprise application)
- Session numbering (could be Session 5, 8, 12, etc.)

## üìä **PHASE TRANSITION TRIGGER ANALYSIS**

### **Automatic Phase Transition Assessment (Claude Desktop Responsibility)**

Before planning ANY session, Claude Desktop MUST evaluate:

#### 1. **Quality/Stabilization Trigger Criteria**
```json
{
  "coreCompleteness": {
    "functionalBaseline": "Can core use case be completed end-to-end?",
    "minimalViableProduct": "Would users find this immediately useful?",
    "primaryWorkflows": "Are main user journeys functional?"
  },
  "sessionMaturity": {
    "featureSessions": "Has 3+ feature development sessions completed?",
    "codebase": "Is there substantial code requiring stabilization?",
    "complexity": "Has technical complexity reached maintenance threshold?"
  },
  "readinessIndicators": {
    "dailyUsage": "Is application ready for real-world testing?",
    "stakeholderReview": "Could this be shown to stakeholders/users?",
    "foundationStable": "Is core architecture solid enough for enhancement?"
  },
  "technicalDebt": {
    "compilationIssues": "Are there TypeScript errors or build warnings?",
    "codeQuality": "Has code quality decreased due to rapid development?",
    "performance": "Are there performance concerns or user experience issues?"
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Phase 2 Transition Trigger Criteria**
```json
{
  "stabilizationComplete": {
    "qualitySession": "Has Comprehensive Quality/Stabilization session completed?",
    "enterpriseStandards": "Are all enterprise quality metrics achieved?",
    "productionReady": "Is application deployment-ready?"
  },
  "userEngagement": {
    "realWorldTesting": "Is application being used for real work?",
    "feedbackCollection": "Are users providing feedback on experience?",
    "iterativeNeeds": "Are enhancement requests emerging from usage?"
  },
  "developmentShift": {
    "foundationComplete": "Is core feature set complete?",
    "enhancementFocus": "Is development shifting from building to improving?",
    "feedbackDriven": "Are development priorities driven by user feedback?"
  }
}
```

## üö® **MANDATORY QUALITY SESSION TRIGGERS**

### **IMMEDIATE Quality Session Required When ANY Condition Met:**

#### **Functional Readiness Triggers**
- ‚úÖ **Core Use Case Complete**: Primary user workflow works end-to-end
- ‚úÖ **MVP Threshold**: Application provides immediate value to users
- ‚úÖ **Real-World Ready**: Could be used for actual productive work
- ‚úÖ **Stakeholder Showable**: Confident enough to demonstrate to others

#### **Development Maturity Triggers**
- ‚úÖ **3+ Feature Sessions**: Substantial codebase requiring stabilization
- ‚úÖ **Technical Complexity**: Architecture has reached maintenance threshold
- ‚úÖ **Before Advanced Features**: Core is ready, advanced features planned next

#### **Quality Debt Triggers**
- üî¥ **Technical Debt Present**: TypeScript errors, ESLint warnings, build issues
- üî¥ **Performance Concerns**: Slow loading, poor user experience
- üî¥ **Code Quality Decline**: Rapid development has created inconsistencies

### **Quality Session Timing Examples by Project Type:**

#### **Context Usage Lessons from Bara Session 8**

**Real-World Data:**
- Session 8 auto-compacted at least twice during execution
- Final attempt reduced to 2% context remaining
- Quality work is significantly more context-intensive than feature development

**Critical Implications for All Projects:**
- **Quality sessions should be scoped at 60-75 minutes maximum** (not 90)
- **Context usage multiplier**: Assume 1.5x normal consumption for quality work
- Consider **progressive quality improvement** rather than comprehensive overhaul
- Plan for **potential session splitting** if scope is complex
- Quality sessions involve extensive codebase analysis, testing, and cross-file modifications

#### **Productivity Applications** (like Bara)
- **Trigger Point**: After core task management, basic workflows complete
- **Typical Session**: 5-8 (depends on feature scope per session)
- **Criteria**: Can manage daily tasks end-to-end

#### **E-commerce Applications**
- **Trigger Point**: After product catalog, cart, checkout complete
- **Typical Session**: 4-7 (depends on complexity)
- **Criteria**: Can complete purchase workflow

#### **Content Management Systems**
- **Trigger Point**: After content creation, editing, publishing complete
- **Typical Session**: 6-10 (depends on feature breadth)
- **Criteria**: Can create and publish content end-to-end

#### **Business Applications**
- **Trigger Point**: After core business logic, data management complete
- **Typical Session**: 4-8 (depends on domain complexity)
- **Criteria**: Can complete primary business workflow

## üéØ **UNIVERSAL SESSION PLANNING INTEGRATION**

### **Enhanced Session Planning Protocol (All Projects)**

Before planning ANY session, Claude Desktop MUST:

#### 1. **Phase Assessment**
```bash
# Evaluate current project phase
- Read previous session status
- Analyze quality trigger criteria
- Assess Phase 2 transition readiness
- Determine appropriate session type
```

#### 2. **Quality Trigger Evaluation**
```bash
# Check for mandatory quality session
- Evaluate functional completeness
- Assess technical debt levels
- Review enterprise standards compliance
- Determine if quality session required before continuing
```

#### 3. **Session Type Determination**
```bash
# Select appropriate session model
- Phase 1: Mega feature sessions (60-90 min)
- Quality Session: Comprehensive stabilization (60-75 min) - REDUCED due to context intensity
- Phase 2: Variable sessions (15-90 min based on scope)
```

#### 4. **Recommendation Generation**
```bash
# Provide clear recommendation
- "Continue Phase 1 development" OR
- "MANDATORY Quality Session Required" OR
- "Ready for Phase 2 transition"
```

## üåç **GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Claude Desktop Actor Enhanced Responsibilities**

#### **Project Lifecycle Management**
1. **Phase Assessment**: Continuously evaluate project phase and transition readiness
2. **Quality Enforcement**: Identify and mandate quality sessions at appropriate points
3. **Transition Planning**: Manage smooth transition from greenfield to iterative development
4. **Universal Application**: Apply framework consistently across all project types

#### **Session-by-Session Analysis**
```
BEFORE EVERY SESSION PLANNING:
1. Assess current project phase
2. Evaluate quality trigger criteria  
3. Check Phase 2 transition readiness
4. Recommend appropriate session type
5. Justify recommendation with criteria
```

#### **Quality Gate Enforcement**
```
QUALITY GATES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
1. Mandate quality sessions when trigger criteria met
2. Prevent Phase 2 transition without quality completion
3. Maintain enterprise standards throughout lifecycle
4. Ensure commercial application readiness
```

### **Integration with Existing Frameworks**
- **Enterprise Development Standards**: Quality criteria enforcement
- **Two-Actor Model**: Enhanced session planning responsibilities
- **Session Templates**: Universal assessment integration
- **Project Documentation**: Phase tracking and transition planning

This framework ensures that **every project** gets the appropriate quality and transition treatment at the right time, regardless of domain or complexity. The specific session number may vary, but the quality standards and transition criteria remain consistent across all projects.
