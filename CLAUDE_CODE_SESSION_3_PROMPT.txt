cd /Volumes/DevDrive/ClaudeProjects/active/Bara-v1
./claude-code-aggressive.sh

If the aggressive script doesn't work, run regular claude-code and immediately run:
/permissions add *

Now execute Session 3 for the Bara-v1 project. This is a DOUBLE SESSION (90 minutes) combining Task System and Keyboard Navigation.

For this session, you have permission to:
- Create all files and directories
- Run all npm/npx commands
- Install all packages
- Modify any files in the project
- Execute git commands
- Run the development server
- Modify keyboard event handlers

Please proceed with Session 3 without asking for individual approvals.

The session definition is located at:
/Volumes/DevDrive/ClaudeProjects/active/Bara-v1/sessions/session-03-tasks-keyboard.md

Please:
1. Read the entire session document carefully
2. Execute ALL implementation steps in order
3. Complete both Part A (Task CRUD) and Part B (Keyboard Shortcuts)
4. Run all verification steps as you go
5. Ensure everything works before the final git push
6. **IMPORTANT**: Save your completion report to:
   /Volumes/DevDrive/ClaudeProjects/active/Bara-v1/sessions/session-03-status.json
7. Confirm the session is complete and the status file is saved

Important notes:
- This is a 90-minute double session - complete BOTH parts
- Focus on making task operations smooth and keyboard shortcuts responsive
- All verification steps are part of implementation
- Only push to GitHub after all verification passes
- The status report MUST be saved as a file, not just displayed

The session includes building the complete task management system with full keyboard control.
