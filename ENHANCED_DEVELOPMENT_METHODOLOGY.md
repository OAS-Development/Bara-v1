# Enhanced Two-Actor Development Model
## Supporting Full Project Lifecycle

### Session Type Classifications

#### 1. **Feature Sessions** (Current Model)
- **Purpose**: Implement new functionality
- **Duration**: 80-90 minutes
- **Context Focus**: New code creation
- **Success Metrics**: Features implemented, tests pass, builds succeed
- **Examples**: Sessions 1-7

#### 2. **Quality Sessions** 
- **Purpose**: Code quality, testing, bug fixes
- **Duration**: 90 minutes (quality work is less context-intensive)
- **Context Focus**: Existing code improvement
- **Success Metrics**: Test coverage, performance scores, zero errors
- **Examples**: Proposed Session 8

#### 3. **Testing Sessions**
- **Purpose**: Real-world usage testing, edge case discovery
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Context Focus**: User experience validation
- **Success Metrics**: Issues identified, user flows validated
- **Examples**: Manual testing, user feedback integration

#### 4. **Iteration Sessions**
- **Purpose**: Refine existing features based on usage
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes (smaller scope)
- **Context Focus**: Incremental improvements
- **Success Metrics**: UX improvements, user satisfaction
- **Examples**: Refinements after real-world use

#### 5. **Maintenance Sessions**
- **Purpose**: Bug fixes, security updates, dependency updates
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes (as needed)
- **Context Focus**: Stability and security
- **Success Metrics**: Issues resolved, security maintained
- **Examples**: Critical bug fixes, security patches

### Development Lifecycle Transition Criteria

#### **When to Transition from Feature Development to Quality Phase:**
✅ **Trigger Conditions (ALL must be met):**
- Core feature set complete (GTD + AI + Life Management ✅)
- Production-ready UI/UX ✅
- PWA/mobile optimization complete ✅
- No critical functionality missing ✅
- Ready for daily usage ✅

#### **When to Transition from Quality to Testing Phase:**
- Zero compilation errors
- >80% test coverage on critical paths
- All ESLint warnings resolved
- Performance targets met (>90 Lighthouse)
- Security audit passed

#### **When to Transition from Testing to Enhancement Phase:**
- No critical bugs discovered
- User workflows validated
- Edge cases handled
- Real-world usage patterns understood

### Modified Session Planning Process

#### **For Feature Sessions** (Sessions 1-7):
1. Analyze previous session context usage
2. Plan new features based on roadmap
3. Create complete implementation prompt
4. Execute with full autonomous permissions

#### **For Quality Sessions** (Session 8):
1. Audit current codebase state
2. Identify quality issues and technical debt
3. Prioritize fixes by impact and effort
4. Create comprehensive quality improvement prompt

#### **For Testing Sessions** (Sessions 9+):
1. Define testing scenarios and user workflows
2. Create systematic testing approach
3. Plan iteration based on discovered issues
4. Focus on user experience over new features

#### **For Iteration Sessions** (Ongoing):
1. Gather usage feedback and pain points
2. Identify highest-impact improvements
3. Plan small, focused refinements
4. Validate improvements with users

### Success Metrics by Session Type

#### **Feature Sessions:**
- Features implemented successfully
- Build passes without errors
- Basic functionality works
- Context usage optimized

#### **Quality Sessions:**
- Code quality metrics improved
- Test coverage increased
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security vulnerabilities addressed

#### **Testing Sessions:**
- User workflows completed successfully
- Edge cases identified and documented
- UX issues catalogued
- Real-world usage validated

#### **Iteration Sessions:**
- User satisfaction improved
- Pain points addressed
- Performance optimized
- Feature adoption increased

### Context Window Management by Session Type

#### **Feature Sessions:**
- Target 40-50% context usage
- Reduce scope if previous session >60%
- Focus on complete feature implementation

#### **Quality Sessions:**
- Can use up to 70% context (comprehensive fixes)
- Less context-intensive than feature creation
- Focus on systematic improvements

#### **Testing Sessions:**
- 30-50% context usage
- Document findings extensively
- Focus on issue identification

#### **Iteration Sessions:**
- 20-40% context usage (smaller scope)
- Quick, targeted improvements
- Focus on user experience refinements

### Recommended Bara-v1 Next Steps

#### **Immediate: Session 8 (Quality)**
- Comprehensive code quality and stabilization
- Testing infrastructure setup
- Bug fixes and edge case handling
- Performance and security audit

#### **Phase 2: Sessions 9-10 (Testing)**
- Real-world usage testing
- User workflow validation
- Edge case discovery
- UX refinement planning

#### **Phase 3: Sessions 11+ (Enhancement)**
- Advanced features based on usage patterns
- Integrations and automation
- Analytics and insights
- Ongoing refinements

This methodology ensures we transition from "building" to "refining" at the optimal time while maintaining development velocity and code quality.
