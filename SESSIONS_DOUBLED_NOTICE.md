# ðŸ“£ IMPORTANT: Sessions Are Now DOUBLED!

## What Changed?
After successfully completing Session 1, we discovered Claude Code has much more context capacity than initially planned. We've restructured all remaining sessions to be **90-minute double sessions** that combine related features.

## Quick Reference
- **Old Structure**: 35+ sessions Ã— 45 minutes each
- **New Structure**: 18 sessions Ã— 90 minutes each
- **Session 1**: âœ… Complete (stayed at 45 min)
- **Session 2+**: All doubled up!

## For Claude Code
When executing sessions starting with Session 2:
1. Expect 90 minutes of work, not 45
2. Each session has Part A and Part B
3. Complete both parts in one go
4. Single git commit at the end
5. Report covers both parts

## Example: Session 2
- **Part A**: Database Schema & RLS (45 min)
- **Part B**: Layout Components (45 min)
- **Total**: 90 minutes
- **Result**: Complete data layer + UI foundation

## Benefits
- âœ… Build related features together
- âœ… Test integration immediately  
- âœ… Less context switching
- âœ… More satisfying progress
- âœ… Same total development time

## Current Status
- Session 1: âœ… COMPLETE
- Session 2: Ready to execute (Database + Layout)
- Session 3: Planned (Tasks + Keyboard)
- Sessions 4-18: Mapped and ready

Let's build faster and better! ðŸš€
