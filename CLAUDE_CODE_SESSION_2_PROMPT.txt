- Create all files and directories

- Install all packages
- Modify any files in the project
- Execute git commands
- Run the development server

Please proceed with Session 2 without asking for individual approvals.

I need you to execute Session 2 for the Bara-v1 project. This is a DOUBLE SESSION (90 minutes) combining database and layout work.

The session definition is located at:
/Volumes/DevDrive/ClaudeProjects/active/Bara-v1/sessions/session-02-database-layout.md

Please:
1. Read the entire session document carefully
2. Execute ALL implementation steps in order
3. Complete both Part A (Database) and Part B (Layout) 
4. Run all verification steps as you go
5. Ensure everything works before the final git push
6. SAVE the completion status report to /sessions/session-02-status.json
7. Confirm the session is complete and the status file is saved

Important notes:
- This is a 90-minute double session - complete BOTH parts
- You'll need the Supabase project ID for type generation (check .env.local or ask if not set)
- The layout should match the OmniFocus-style dark theme
- All verification steps are part of implementation
- Only push to GitHub after all verification passes

The session includes everything from database schema creation through to the complete three-panel layout.
