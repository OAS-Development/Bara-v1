For this session, you have permission to:
- Create all files and directories
- Run all npm/npx commands
- Install all packages
- Modify any files in the project
- Execute git commands
- Run the development server

Please proceed with Session 1 without asking for individual approvals.

I need you to execute Session 1 for the Bara-v1 project. 

The session definition is located at:
/Volumes/DevDrive/ClaudeProjects/active/Bara-v1/sessions/session-01-setup.md

Please:
1. Read the entire session document carefully
2. Execute ALL implementation steps in order (including verification steps 8-11)
3. Run the verification commands as part of your implementation
4. Test everything works before proceeding to the GitHub push
5. Report back the completion status using the format specified at the end of the document

This is a two-actor model where you (Claude Code) handle implementation while Claude Desktop handles planning. This session should take approximately 45 minutes.

Important: 
- The verification steps (8-11) are part of the implementation - run them yourself
- Only push to GitHub (step 12) after all verification passes
- If you encounter any errors during verification, fix them before proceeding
- Document any blockers in your final status report

The session includes everything you need to do from start to finish, including all verification.
