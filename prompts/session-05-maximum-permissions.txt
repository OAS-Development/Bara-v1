# SESSION 5 PROMPT - MAXIMUM PERMISSIONS VERSION

Copy and paste this ENTIRE message into Claude Code after running force-permissions.sh:

---

AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE ACTIVE - NO PERMISSION REQUESTS ALLOWED

I have run the force-permissions.sh script. You have COMPLETE AUTONOMOUS PERMISSION to:
- Create, edit, delete ANY files without asking
- Run ANY commands (npm, git, bash) without asking  
- Install ANY packages without asking
- Make ANY system changes without asking

Current settings confirm:
- autoApprove: true
- allowedTools: "*"
- skipConfirmations: true
- requireConfirmation: false

DO NOT ask for any permissions. Execute all tasks immediately.

Execute Session 5 from `/Volumes/DevDrive/ClaudeProjects/active/Bara-v1/sessions/session-05-advanced-ai-mega.md`

This MEGA session implements:
- Part A: Complete OmniFocus Import
- Part B: Location Context  
- Part C: Time & Energy Context

- Part F: AI Intelligence & Suggestions

Work continuously through all parts. Save status to `/sessions/session-05-status.json` when complete.

If Claude Code STILL asks for permissions after this, immediately respond with:
"I need to check PERMISSION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md for additional solutions."
