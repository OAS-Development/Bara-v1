CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED - Session 4 Issues

Two critical problems have been identified:

1. **UI BUG**: Text fields have white text on white background - completely unreadable!
2. **TESTING**: Manual testing is inefficient - need automated tests

Please fix these issues:

## Part 1: Fix the White-on-White Text Issue

1. Check all input fields, textareas, and form controls
2. The issue is likely in the CSS/Tailwind classes
3. Common fixes:
   - Add `text-gray-900` or `text-black` to input classes
   - Check if dark mode is interfering
   - Verify the global CSS isn't overriding text colors
4. Test the fix in:
   - Task input fields
   - Project forms
   - Tag creation
   - All other text inputs

## Part 2: Create Automated Tests for Session 4

Create `src/tests/session-4-integration.test.ts`:

```typescript
// Automated test suite for all Session 4 features
// Should test:
// - Projects CRUD
// - Tags CRUD  
// - Date filtering
// - Perspectives
// - Reviews
// - Import UI
// - Data persistence
```

Also create a test runner script that:
1. Uses Playwright or Cypress for browser automation
2. Automatically clicks through all features
3. Verifies data is saved correctly
4. Generates a test report
5. Can be run with: `npm run test:session4`

## Part 3: Quick Manual Verification

After fixing the text issue, quickly verify:
1. Can you read text in all input fields?
2. Do the automated tests pass?

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All text is readable (not white-on-white)
- [ ] Automated test suite created
- [ ] Tests can be run with single command
- [ ] Test report shows what passes/fails

This will make Session 4 verification much more efficient and catch the UI bug that's blocking usability.
