# ðŸŽ¯ THE SOLUTION: --dangerously-skip-permissions

## THIS IS THE FLAG WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR!

After all the troubleshooting, permission scripts, and workarounds, the solution is a single flag:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## Complete Launch Command:
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --allowedTools "*" --autoApprove true
```

## What This Flag Does:
- **SKIPS ALL PERMISSION PROMPTS**
- Bypasses the entire permission system
- No more interruptions during sessions
- True autonomous execution

## Updated Scripts:
All launch scripts have been updated to include this flag:
- `force-permissions.sh` - Now includes the flag
- `claude-aggressive.sh` - Updated with the flag
- `launch-claude.sh` - Simple launcher with the flag

## To Use Right Now:
```bash
# Option 1: Run the updated force-permissions script
./force-permissions.sh

# Option 2: Launch directly
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Option 3: Use the simple launcher
./launch-claude.sh
```

## Why We Missed This:
- The flag name suggests danger/caution
- Not documented in the standard help
- Other flags seemed like they should work
- `--autoApprove` and similar flags were red herrings

## The Lesson:
Sometimes the solution is a single undocumented flag that does exactly what we need!

**Remember:** Use this flag for trusted projects where you want zero friction development.
