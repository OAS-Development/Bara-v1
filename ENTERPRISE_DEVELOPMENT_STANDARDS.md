# Enterprise Development Standards
## Global Quality Requirements for All Projects

### 🎯 **Mission Statement**
Every application developed using the two-actor methodology must meet enterprise-grade standards suitable for deployment by large organizations in mission-critical environments.

### 🌍 **Universal Application Framework**
These standards apply consistently across:
- **All Project Domains**: Productivity, e-commerce, CMS, business applications, utilities
- **All Technology Stacks**: React, Vue, Python, Django, Node.js, etc.
- **All Project Sizes**: Small utilities to enterprise applications
- **All Session Numbers**: Quality triggers based on criteria, not fixed session numbers

**See `GLOBAL_LIFECYCLE_MANAGEMENT.md` for complete project phase transition framework.**

## 📋 **Mandatory Quality Standards**

```

## 🚨 **Quality Trigger Criteria (Universal)**

### **Automatic Quality Session Required When ANY Condition Met:**

**NOTE**: These criteria apply to ALL projects regardless of domain or session numbering.

#### **Functional Readiness Triggers**
- ✅ **Core Use Case Complete**: Primary user workflow works end-to-end
- ✅ **MVP Threshold**: Application provides immediate value to users  
- ✅ **Real-World Ready**: Could be used for actual productive work
- ✅ **Stakeholder Showable**: Confident enough to demonstrate to others

#### **Development Maturity Triggers**
- ✅ **3+ Feature Sessions**: Substantial codebase requiring stabilization
- ✅ **Technical Complexity**: Architecture has reached maintenance threshold
- ✅ **Before Advanced Features**: Core is ready, advanced features planned next

#### **Quality Debt Triggers**
- 🔴 **Technical Debt Present**: TypeScript errors, ESLint warnings, build issues
- 🔴 **Performance Concerns**: Slow loading, poor user experience
- 🔴 **Code Quality Decline**: Rapid development has created inconsistencies

### **Universal Examples by Project Type:**
- **Productivity Apps**: After core task management complete (Session 5-8)
- **E-commerce**: After product catalog, cart, checkout complete (Session 4-7)
- **CMS**: After content creation, editing, publishing complete (Session 6-10)
- **Business Apps**: After core business logic and data management complete (Session 4-8)

**The specific session number varies, but the criteria remain consistent.**

### **Emergency Quality Session Required When:**
- 🔴 Critical security vulnerabilities discovered
- 🔴 Performance regression detected
- 🔴 Accessibility compliance broken
- 🔴 Production deployment blocked by quality issues

## 👥 **Enterprise Application Assumptions**

### **Target Users:**
- **Large Organizations**: Fortune 500 companies, government agencies
- **Mission-Critical Usage**: Daily productivity, business operations
- **High Standards**: Enterprise IT departments with strict requirements
- **Compliance Needs**: Security, accessibility, performance mandates
- **Scale Requirements**: Hundreds to thousands of users
- **Reliability Expectations**: 99.9%+ uptime, graceful failure handling

### **Deployment Environments:**
- **Enterprise Networks**: Strict security policies, firewall restrictions
- **Mobile Devices**: iOS/Android with varying capabilities
- **Diverse Browsers**: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge compatibility
- **Accessibility Tools**: Screen readers, keyboard navigation
- **Performance Constraints**: Slow networks, older devices

## 🎯 **Claude Desktop Actor Quality Responsibilities (Universal)**

### **MUST ALWAYS (All Projects):**
1. **Identify Quality Trigger Points**
   - Apply universal trigger criteria regardless of project domain
   - Monitor sessions for quality trigger criteria across all project types
   - Recognize when enterprise standards are at risk
   - Proactively recommend Quality/Stabilization sessions

2. **Apply Global Lifecycle Management**
   - Assess project phase (Greenfield vs Iterative) before every session
   - Evaluate Phase 1 → Phase 2 transition readiness
   - Use universal criteria regardless of session numbering
   - Manage transitions consistently across all project types

3. **Insist on Enterprise Standards**
   - Never compromise on quality requirements regardless of project scope
