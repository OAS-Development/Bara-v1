# AI Integration Architecture

## Overview
Bara-v1 integrates Claude API to provide intelligent task management and knowledge synthesis while maintaining strict privacy and security standards.

## Privacy-First Design Principles

1. **Selective AI Processing**
   - User explicitly opts-in for AI features per task/project
   - Sensitive data can be marked as "local-only"
   - AI processing happens only on user command, not automatically

2. **Data Minimization**
   - Only send necessary context to Claude API
   - Strip PII when possible before API calls
   - Use local LLMs for sensitive operations when feasible

3. **Encryption Flow**
   ```
   User Input → Client Encryption → Database Storage
                ↓ (on AI request)
              Decrypt locally → Process → Send to Claude API
                                         ↓
                               Receive response → Re-encrypt → Store
   ```

## Key AI Features Implementation

### 1. Natural Language Task Processing
```typescript
// Example: "Schedule dentist appointment next Tuesday morning"
interface NLPTaskRequest {
  input: string;
  context: {
    currentDate: Date;
    userTimezone: string;
    existingContexts: string[];
    activeProjects: string[];
  };
}

// Claude analyzes and returns structured data
interface ParsedTask {
  title: string;
  dueDate?: Date;
  deferDate?: Date;
  contexts: string[];
  project?: string;
  notes?: string;
  confidence: number;
}
```

### 2. Weekly Review Assistant
- Analyzes completed vs planned tasks
- Identifies patterns and bottlenecks
- Suggests process improvements
- Generates review summary with insights

### 3. Project Planning Intelligence
```typescript
interface ProjectPlanningRequest {
  projectGoal: string;
  constraints: {
    deadline?: Date;
    availableHours?: number;
    resources?: string[];
  };
  similarProjects?: ProjectHistory[];
}

interface ProjectPlan {
  phases: Phase[];
  milestones: Milestone[];
  estimatedDuration: number;
  riskFactors: string[];
  suggestedTasks: Task[];
}
```

### 4. Knowledge Graph Builder
- Extracts entities and relationships from tasks/notes
- Creates visual knowledge maps
- Suggests connections between projects
- Enables semantic search across all content

### 5. Smart Context Switching
```typescript
interface ContextRecommendation {
  currentLocation?: GeoLocation;
  timeOfDay: string;
  energyLevel?: number;
  upcomingCalendarEvents: CalendarEvent[];
  recentActivity: Task[];
}

// Returns prioritized task list based on context
interface ContextualTaskList {
  recommendedTasks: Task[];
  reasoning: string;
  focusTime: number;
  alternativeContexts: Context[];
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic NLP Integration
- Task parsing from natural language
- Simple query understanding
- Basic summarization

### Phase 2: Advanced Intelligence
- Pattern recognition
- Predictive suggestions
- Complex project planning

### Phase 3: Personal AI Assistant
- Conversational task management
- Proactive recommendations
- Learning from user behavior

## API Integration Points

1. **Task Creation Flow**
   ```
   Voice/Text Input → Local Processing → Claude API → 
   Structured Task → User Confirmation → Database
   ```

2. **Review Generation**
   ```
   Gather Week Data → Anonymize → Claude Analysis → 
   Insights Generation → User Review → Store Learnings
   ```

3. **Knowledge Synthesis**
   ```
   Search Query → Context Gathering → Claude API → 
   Relevant Results + Insights → User Display
   ```

## Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Audit logs for all AI interactions
- Option to use self-hosted models for sensitive data
- Regular security audits of AI integration points

## Performance Optimization

- Cache common AI responses
- Batch similar requests
- Use streaming for long-form content
- Implement request debouncing
- Progressive enhancement (works without AI)
