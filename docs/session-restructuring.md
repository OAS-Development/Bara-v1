# Session Restructuring Reference

## Why We Doubled Sessions
After Session 1, we discovered Claude Code has significantly more context capacity than initially estimated. By combining related sessions, we can:
- Complete features end-to-end in one session
- Reduce context switching
- Test integrated functionality immediately
- Maintain better development flow

## Session Mapping (Old → New)

| New Session | Combines Old | Duration | Focus |
|------------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Session 1 ✅ | Session 1 | 45 min | Project Setup & Auth |
| Session 2 | Sessions 2+3 | 90 min | Database & Layout |
| Session 3 | Sessions 4+5 | 90 min | Tasks & Keyboard |
| Session 4 | Sessions 6+7 | 90 min | Projects & Tags |
| Session 5 | Sessions 8+9 | 90 min | Time & Views |
| Session 6 | Sessions 10+11 | 90 min | Reviews & Import Start |
| Session 7 | Sessions 12+13 | 90 min | Complete Import |
| Session 8 | Sessions 14+15+16 | 90 min | Context Engine |
| Session 9 | Sessions 17+18 | 90 min | AI Integration |
| Session 10 | Sessions 19+20 | 90 min | Library & Templates |
| Session 11 | Sessions 21+22 | 90 min | Travel & Financial |
| Session 12 | Sessions 23+24 | 90 min | Collaboration & UI |

## Benefits Realized

1. **Better Integration**: Features that work together are built together
2. **Immediate Testing**: Can test feature combinations right away
3. **Less Overhead**: Fewer session starts/stops
4. **Natural Breakpoints**: Sessions end at logical feature boundaries
5. **Maintained Timeline**: Still ~27 hours total development time

## Implementation Notes

- Each session still follows the verification-first approach
- Documentation includes both Part A and Part B objectives
- Claude Code executes the full 90 minutes
- Status reports cover both parts
- Git commits summarize both feature sets

## For Claude Code

When executing double sessions:
1. Complete Part A first (usually ~45 min)
2. Run Part A verification
3. Move to Part B without stopping
4. Run combined verification at end
5. Single git commit covering both parts
6. Report includes all accomplishments

## For Claude Desktop

When planning sessions:
1. Consider feature relationships
2. Group complementary work
3. Ensure clear handoffs between sessions
4. Update CURRENT_STATE.md after each
5. Plan next session based on double capacity
