# Bara-v1 Figma Design Progress

## Current Status
The Bara-v1 design has been created but is currently in a shared Figma document. It has been moved to coordinates (4900, -50) and wrapped in a "BARA-V1 SECTION" frame to separate it from other designs.

**Recommendation**: Create a new Figma file specifically for Bara-v1 to keep the design system organized.

## Design System Created
I've created the initial Figma layout for Bara-v1 that maintains the OmniFocus aesthetic while preparing for our enhanced features.

### Current Design Elements:

#### Layout Structure (Frame ID: 244:79)
- **Main Container**: 1440x900px dark interface
- **Three-panel layout**:
  1. Sidebar (280px) - Navigation and perspectives
  2. Main Content (760px) - Task lists and views  
  3. Inspector Panel (400px) - Task details and metadata

#### Color Palette (Dark Theme)
- Background: #1a1a1f (main), #26262b (panels)
- Text: #e6e6e6 (primary), #b3b3b3 (secondary), #9999a6 (labels)
- Accents: #4d80e5 (blue for inbox), #666673 (borders)
- Interactive elements: #333338 (input fields)

#### Typography
- Font: Inter (matches modern system fonts)
- Sizes: 24px (logo), 20px (headers), 15px (body), 13px (labels)
- Weights: 600 (semi-bold) for headers, 400 (regular) for body

#### Components Created
1. **Sidebar Items**: Inbox, Work, Personal perspectives with icons
2. **Task List Items**: Checkbox + title layout
3. **Inspector Sections**: Status selector, Project dropdown
4. **Header Bar**: Clean title area for current view

### Next Design Steps:

1. **Enhanced Perspectives**
   - Library icon and view
   - Travel perspective  
   - Financial perspective
   - Forecast calendar integration

2. **Task Enhancements**
   - AI suggestion indicators
   - Context badges (location, energy, time)
   - Quick capture bar
   - Rich task preview

3. **New Features UI**
   - Receipt capture modal
   - Travel planning cards
   - Book comparison views
   - Claude chat interface

4. **Mobile Responsive Design**
   - Collapsible panels
   - Touch-friendly controls
   - Swipe gestures
   - Bottom navigation for mobile

### Design Principles
- **Familiarity**: Keep OmniFocus muscle memory
- **Enhancement**: Add features without clutter
- **Clarity**: Information hierarchy remains clear
- **Efficiency**: Power user shortcuts preserved
- **Adaptability**: Context-aware UI changes

The Figma file is now set up as a living design document we can iterate on as we build Bara-v1.
