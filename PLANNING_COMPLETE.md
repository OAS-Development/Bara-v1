## Ready for Claude Code

### Session 1 is Ready to Execute
Location: `/sessions/session-01-setup.md`

**Session 1 will deliver:**
- Next.js project initialization
- Supabase authentication
- Basic folder structure
- Protected routes
- Login/signup pages

### How to Start
1. Claude Code opens Session 1 document
2. Executes all steps in order
3. Runs verification in parallel terminal
4. Reports completion status

### Next Sessions Planned
- Session 2: Database Schema & Layout Components (90 min DOUBLE SESSION)
- Session 3: Task System & Keyboard Navigation (90 min)
- Session 4: Projects & Tags System (90 min)
- Session 5: Time Management & Views (90 min)
- ... (18 total double sessions)

**Note: Sessions have been restructured as 90-minute double sessions for efficiency**

## Key Innovation: Session-Based Development

Instead of traditional "week-based" planning:
- Each Session is ~45 minutes
- Fits within Claude's context window
- Includes verification steps
- Clean handoffs between actors

This approach ensures:
- No context loss
- Verifiable progress
- Efficient development
- Clear communication
